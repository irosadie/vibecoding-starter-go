# Claude Project Instructions

@.agents/AGENTS.md

Claude-compatible skill entries are in `.claude/skills/`.
Source of truth remains in `.agents/skills/`.

## Additional Principles for Claude

- **Always apply current best practices** — use recommended patterns and APIs for every technology (Next.js App Router, Hono, BullMQ, Prisma, React Query, Zod). Don't use old patterns when better ones exist.
- **Search the web if unsure** — if you don't know the latest approach, correct API, or best practice, **use WebSearch or WebFetch before writing code**. Better slow and correct than fast and wrong.
- **Follow the established flow** — planning via OpenSpec (`/opsx:propose`), then implementation per task with the matching skill. Implementation order per feature: Slicing → Backend+OpenAPI → FE↔API Integration.
- **Read skill before executing** — every task has its skill. Read `SKILL.md` + `references/context.md` + `templates/checklist.md` before starting.
- **Follow Biome rules** — before writing code, read `biome.json` at root. Forbidden: `any`, `console.*`, unused variables/imports. Required: `const`, double quote, no semicolons. Your code must pass all rules.

## Start Session

If the user only types `Start`, `Mulai`, `Mulai Vibe Coding`, or similar:
1. Run `bun run session:status`
2. Summarize MCP status, branch, and worktree
3. Determine if this is first init, resume last task, or ready for new work
4. Ask one clear next-step question
