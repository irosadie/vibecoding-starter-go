# vibecoding-starter

Starter monorepo for building products with **vibe coding** — a workflow where AI agents (Claude Code / Codex) handle implementation tasks end-to-end, from feature planning to merge-ready PRs.

This repo provides two things:
1. **Production-ready starter monorepo** (Next.js + Go/Echo + asynq + local PostgreSQL + local Redis)
2. **Agent system** (`.agents/`) containing skills, guides, and code examples used by AI agents during coding

Status:
- Open source under [MIT](./LICENSE) license
- Clone, fork, use as a baseline for new projects, or contribute back via pull requests
- Agent workflow source of truth lives in `.agents/`

## Quick Start

Prerequisites:
- Bun `>= 1.3`
- Go `>= 1.26`
- Docker

```bash
bun install
bun run bootstrap
bun run dev
```

`bun run bootstrap` will:
- Copy `.env.example` to `.env` if it doesn't exist
- Start PostgreSQL and Redis
- Wait for services to be ready
- Run goose migrations
- Generate merged OpenAPI spec

After bootstrapping, initialize OpenSpec for the planning layer:

```bash
bunx openspec init
```

This sets up the `openspec/` directory and generates slash commands for your AI tool of choice:
- **Claude Code** — commands are added to `.claude/commands/`
- **Codex** — invoke skills with `$openspec-propose`, `$openspec-apply-change`, etc.
- **OpenCode** — instructions are loaded via `opencode.md` and `.opencode.json`

Daily commands:
```bash
bun run stack:up
bun run stack:down
bun run stack:logs
bun run session:status
bun run go:build
bun run go:test
bun run openapi:generate
```

Backend-specific (run from `apps/api/`):
```bash
go run ./cmd/server/main.go        # dev server
go test ./...                      # run tests
sqlc generate                      # regenerate DB queries
goose -dir db/migrations postgres "$DATABASE_URL" up   # run migrations
```

## Key Endpoints
- Web: `http://localhost:3000`
- Web login: `http://localhost:3000/login`
- Web register: `http://localhost:3000/register`
- Web auth route: `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/*`
- Web internal proxy: `http://localhost:3000/api/proxy/*`
- API root: `http://localhost:8080/`
- API health: `http://localhost:8080/health`
- API auth: `http://localhost:8080/api/auth/*`
- Merged OpenAPI spec: `docs/openapi.json`

## OpenAPI & Scalar

The OpenAPI workflow is ready for docs tooling:
- Split JSON source of truth in `docs/openapi/base.json`, `docs/openapi/paths/*.json`, and `docs/openapi/schemas/*.json`
- Merged artifact at `docs/openapi.json`
- Merge generator runs via `bun run openapi:generate`

This means:
- Don't edit `docs/openapi.json` directly
- Update specs in the split `docs/openapi/` folder
- Regenerate the merged spec afterward

## Quality Checks

```bash
bun run check
```

Partial commands:
```bash
bun run lint          # Biome lint (frontend)
bun run typecheck     # TypeScript typecheck (frontend)
bun run test          # frontend tests
bun run go:test       # Go tests (api + worker)
bun run go:build      # Go build (api + worker)
bun run build         # full turbo build
```

Generate merged OpenAPI spec:
```bash
bun run openapi:generate
```

## Start a Session

Type **"Start"** or **"Mulai Vibe Coding"** in Claude Code or Codex.

The agent will run a quick check:
- Check repo-level MCP (`.mcp.json`) and missing services
- Check active branch and whether there's work in progress

Then it will direct the session to one of:
- Set up MCP first
- Resume last task
- Start a new feature via OpenSpec (`/opsx:propose`)

To run the same quick check manually:

```bash
bun run session:status
```

### Invoking Skills Explicitly

Skills can be invoked directly — use these if you want full control:

**Claude Code** — use `/` prefix:
```
/web-slicing
/api-feature
/web-api-integrated
```

**Codex** — use `$` prefix:
```
$web-slicing
$api-feature
$web-api-integrated
```

Full skill list available in `.agents/AGENTS.md` under `Skill Registry`.

## Developing the Agent System

### Creating a New Skill

Use the `skill-creator` skill to add new capabilities to the agent system.

**Claude:** `/skill-creator` &nbsp;|&nbsp; **Codex:** `$skill-creator`

Or run the generator directly:

```bash
bun run skills:create -- \
  --name {scope}-{capability} \
  --scope {scope} \
  --description "{One-line description}" \
  --when "{When to use}"
```

The generator creates the full structure:

```
.agents/skills/{name}/
├── SKILL.md                → Definition + workflow + constraints + checklist
├── references/context.md   → Target folders + code examples + patterns
├── templates/checklist.md  → Step-by-step execution checklist
└── agents/openai.yaml      → Codex/OpenAI metadata
.claude/skills/{name}/
└── SKILL.md                → Claude wrapper (auto-generated)
```

After creating or modifying skills:

```bash
bun run skills:sync      # sync Claude wrappers from source of truth
bun run skills:validate  # validate all skill assets
```

### Adding Training Data / Code Examples

Use the `skill-add-example` skill to add real code examples as agent references.

**Claude:** `/skill-add-example` &nbsp;|&nbsp; **Codex:** `$skill-add-example`

Examples are stored in `.agents/examples/`:

```
.agents/examples/
└── {skill-name}/
    └── {framework-or-context}/
        └── {example-name}/
            ├── page.tsx
            └── hooks/
```

Each example must be referenced in the related skill's `references/context.md` so the agent can find it during execution.

## Vibe Coding Flow

Feature development in this repo uses AI agents. Planning is handled by [OpenSpec](https://github.com/Fission-AI/OpenSpec), implementation is guided by **skills** — structured instructions the agent reads before executing tasks.

**All feature work must follow the OpenSpec workflow.**

Why:
- **Structured thinking** — forces upfront design before implementation, reducing rework and scope creep
- **Traceability** — every feature has documented proposal, specs, design, and tasks in `openspec/changes/`
- **Quality assurance** — changes are reviewed against specs before archiving
- **Context preservation** — future developers and AI agents can understand why decisions were made
- **Collaboration** — clear handoff between propose → implement → verify phases

Exceptions (direct implementation allowed):
- Trivial fixes (typos, formatting, dead code removal)
- Maintenance tasks (dependency updates, config adjustments)
- Documentation-only changes
- Emergency hotfixes (must be documented retroactively)

### Phase 1 — Propose (OpenSpec)

Turn a feature idea into a proposal, specs, design, and task list.

```
Trigger: /opsx:propose "feature name"
Output:  openspec/changes/{slug}/
           proposal.md
           specs/
           design.md
           tasks.md
```

---

### Phase 2 — Implementation (per task)

Execution order per feature:

#### 2a. FE Slicing
> Skill: `web-slicing`

Implement UI from design/description — no real data yet, use dummy.

```
Target: apps/web/app/(group)/[feature]/
Output: page.tsx + [feature]-content.tsx
```

#### 2b. Backend + OpenAPI
> Skill: `api-feature` + `docs-openapi`

Implement Clean Architecture in Go/Echo: entity → use case → repository → controller → route.
Write split OpenAPI documentation alongside.

```
Target: apps/api/internal/
         docs/openapi/
```

#### 2c. FE ↔ API Integration
> Skill: `web-api-integrated`

Create Zod schemas, response types, constants, and react-query hooks. Wire the sliced UI to the running API.

```
Target: packages/schemas/
         packages/types/
         apps/web/hooks/transactions/use-{domain}/
         apps/web/constants/
```

---

### Phase 3 — Verify & Archive (OpenSpec)

```
Trigger: /opsx:verify     → validate implementation
         /opsx:archive    → archive specs after completion
```
