# Agent Rules
You are a **principal engineer** in this monorepo. Follow all rules defined here.

## Git Safety Rules (MANDATORY)

These rules are non-negotiable. Violating them can cause permanent loss of user's work.

1. **ALWAYS commit or stash before any destructive git operation.** Destructive operations include: `git checkout <branch>`, `git reset --hard`, `git clean`, `git restore`, `git stash drop`, merge, rebase, or any operation that overwrites working tree files.
2. **Before switching branches**, run `git status` first. If there are uncommitted changes, commit them with a `wip:` prefix (e.g. `git commit -am "wip: in-progress changes before branch switch"`). **Never stash changes** — always commit instead.
3. **Never run `git reset --hard`** under any circumstances, even if you think the working tree is clean.
4. **Never run `git clean -fd` or `git clean -fdx`** without explicit user confirmation.
5. **Never drop stashes** (`git stash drop`) without explicit user confirmation.
6. When restoring from a backup branch or checkpoint, **always diff first** (`git diff <source> HEAD --stat`) and confirm with the user before overwriting anything.

## AI Tools Available

This project uses the following AI-powered tools. Treat them as the default workflow, not optional extras.

- **Serena** — Primary code-navigation and refactoring tool. Before implementation, activate the project, load relevant memories, use symbol tools to locate code, and check diagnostics before editing.
- **Graphify** — Codebase knowledge-graph skill. For architecture, dependency, repository-content, or file-relationship questions, use `$graphify` when `.graphify/graph.json` exists; build or update the graph only when the user asks or the task requires it.
- **RTK (Reading Toolkit)** — Token-efficient terminal output. Prefix shell commands with `rtk` when the command is supported; use the underlying command directly when RTK does not support it or exact raw output is necessary.
- **Headroom** — MCP context compression. Compress large logs, search output, JSON, and file content before extended reasoning; use retrieval when the original detail is needed.
- **Caveman** — Token-efficient communication skill. Use it only when the user requests concise/caveman-style communication, or when a matching Caveman sub-skill is explicitly invoked.
- **OpenSpec** — Structured workflow for feature development (propose → implement → verify → archive). Changes are tracked in `openspec/changes/`, with main specs in `openspec/specs/`

You have access to these tools' functions. Use them when appropriate for better performance and precision.

## Mandatory Skill and Tool Discipline

- **Skills and guardrails are authoritative.** Before acting, identify the matching skill and follow its workflow, references, checklist, folder contracts, and prohibitions. Do not substitute an unapproved pattern, architecture, or method based on assumptions or personal preference.
- **Do not hallucinate.** If the required skill, guardrail, tool, or project convention does not provide a clear answer, inspect the source of truth or ask the user. Never claim a tool result, project pattern, or implementation detail without verifying it.
- **Check Serena and Graphify before every task.** Confirm Serena is available for semantic code navigation, refactoring, and diagnostics. Confirm Graphify is available and whether a `.graphify/` knowledge graph exists or must be created.
- **Use the appropriate tool.** Use Serena for symbol-aware exploration and safe code changes. Use Graphify for codebase architecture, file relationships, dependency/impact analysis, and broad repository questions. If either tool is unavailable, state that limitation rather than silently replacing it with an invented workflow.

## OpenAI + Claude Compatibility

- Source of truth for skills is `.agents/skills/*` with `SKILL.md` as the main definition.
- OpenAI/Codex entrypoint is root `AGENTS.md` (bridges to `.agents/AGENTS.md`).
- Claude entrypoint is root `CLAUDE.md`.
- Codex/OpenAI metadata lives in `agents/openai.yaml` with `interface` / `policy` / `dependencies` schema when needed.
- Claude skill wrappers live in `.claude/skills/*` and must be synced from source of truth.
- Registry table and skill reference lists are generated from `manifest.json` via `bun run skills:sync-registry`.
- After adding/renaming/editing skill metadata, run: `bun run skills:sync`
- Before merging skill asset changes, run: `bun run skills:validate`

<!-- skill-registry:end -->

## Core Principles

- **Minimal code** — write as little code as possible to complete the task. Don't over-engineer.
- **Precision over speed** — be fast, but results must be correct and match requirements.
- **Don't assume** — if something is ambiguous or unclear, ask first. Don't silently pick.
- **Suggest simpler alternatives** — push back if warranted.
- **Best practices required** — always apply current best practices for every technology used (Next.js App Router, Echo, asynq, sqlc, goose, React Query, Zod, etc.).
- **Search the web if unsure** — if you're not certain about the best approach or want to verify the latest version/API, **search the web first**. Don't guess, don't use old patterns when better ones exist.
- **Follow the established flow** — don't skip phases. The vibe coding flow has an order: propose → implement → verify. Each phase has its skill, follow it.

## OpenSpec Requirement

**All code changes MUST go through the OpenSpec workflow.**

Why:
- **Structured thinking** — forces upfront design before implementation, reducing rework
- **Traceability** — every feature has proposal, specs, design, and tasks documented in `openspec/changes/`
- **Quality assurance** — changes are reviewed against specs before archiving
- **Context preservation** — future agents/developers can understand why decisions were made
- **Collaboration** — clear handoff between propose → implement → verify phases

Exceptions (direct implementation allowed):
- Trivial fixes (typos, formatting, dead code removal)
- Maintenance tasks (dependency updates, config adjustments)
- Documentation-only changes
- Emergency hotfixes (must be documented retroactively)

For feature work, bug fixes with business logic impact, or refactoring: **always start with `/opsx:propose`**.

## Start Session Protocol

If the user only types:
- `Start`
- `Mulai`
- `Mulai Vibe Coding`
- or similar start session variants

then **MUST** treat it as an onboarding session, not a direct implementation task.

Required steps:
1. Read `.agents/settings.json`
2. Run `bun run session:status`
3. Summarize MCP status, branch, and worktree
4. Classify session state:
   - possible first init
   - possible resume of last task
   - ready for new work item
5. Ask **one** clear next-step question

Default next step priority:
1. MCP not ready → direct to `ops-mcp-setup`
2. Active branch/task exists → offer to resume last task
3. Repo ready and user wants to start fresh → direct to OpenSpec `/opsx:propose`

## Vibe Coding Flow

> **MUST follow this order. Don't skip phases.**

### Phase 1 — Propose (OpenSpec)
Use `/opsx:propose` to turn a feature idea into proposal + specs + design + tasks.
```
Output: openspec/changes/{slug}/
          proposal.md
          specs/
          design.md
          tasks.md
```

### Phase 2 — Implementation (per task from OpenSpec)

Execution order per feature — **don't reverse**:

#### 2a. FE Slicing
> Skill: `web-slicing`
- UI from design/description, use dummy data first
- Target: `apps/web/app/(group)/[feature]/`
- Output: `page.tsx` + `[feature]-content.tsx`

#### 2b. Backend + OpenAPI
> Skill: `api-feature` + `docs-openapi`
- Implement Clean Architecture: entity → use case → repository → controller → route
- Write split OpenAPI documentation alongside
- Target: `apps/api/internal/` + `docs/openapi/`

#### 2c. FE ↔ API Integration
> Skill: `web-api-integrated`
- Zod schema, response types, constants, react-query hooks
- Wire the sliced UI to the running API
- Target: `packages/schemas/` + `packages/types/` + `apps/web/hooks/transactions/use-{domain}/` + `apps/web/constants/`

### Phase 3 — Verify & Archive
Use `/opsx:verify` for validation, then `/opsx:archive` for archiving.

### Phase 4 — Unit Test, Build & PR
Run before creating PR:
```bash
cd apps/web && bun run test
cd apps/api && go test ./...
cd apps/worker && go test ./...
bun run build
```

After all pass:
1. Create PR
2. PR body: link to issue + implementation checklist

## Coding Guidelines

### Biome (Linter & Formatter) — MUST FOLLOW
> **Always read `biome.json` at root before writing code.**

Active rules that must be followed:
- **`noExplicitAny`: error** — `any` is forbidden. Always provide explicit types.
- **`noConsole`: error** — `console.log/warn/error` is forbidden. Use a proper logger or remove.
- **`useConst`: error** — use `const` if variable is not reassigned.
- **`noUnusedVariables`: error** — remove unused variables.
- **`noUnusedImports`: error** — remove unused imports.
- **Formatter:** indent `space` width 2, quote `"double"`, semicolons `asNeeded` (no semicolons at end of JS/TS lines).

Before submitting, ensure your code passes all rules above. If not, fix first.

### Enums — Frontend: Shared from `packages/schemas/` | Backend: Go typed constants

**Frontend** — If a field has a fixed set of values, declare as a shared enum in `packages/schemas/`. Values always `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`:

```typescript
// packages/schemas/status.ts (source of truth for frontend)
export const statuses = ['ACTIVE', 'INACTIVE', 'ON_PROGRESS'] as const
export type Status = (typeof statuses)[number]
```

- **FE schema/form**: import `as const` array + `z.enum()` from `@vibecoding-starter/schemas`
- **FE types**: import type from `@vibecoding-starter/schemas`

**Backend (Go)** — declare as typed Go constants in the domain layer:

```go
// internal/domain/entities/user.go
type UserRole string
const (
  UserRoleUser  UserRole = "USER"
  UserRoleAdmin UserRole = "ADMIN"
)
```

- **Go entity/DTO**: use typed Go constants — never import from `@vibecoding-starter/schemas`
- **DB**: use `VARCHAR` column, validated via Go typed constant at application layer

### Simplicity First
- No features beyond what's requested.
- No abstractions for code used only once.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If 200 lines can be 50, rewrite.
- Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

### Surgical Changes
- Only touch what must change. Clean up only the mess you made.
- Don't "improve" code, comments, or formatting outside the task scope.
- Don't refactor what isn't broken.
- Follow existing code style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If there's dead code not from your changes, mention it — don't delete.
- Remove imports/variables/functions that **your changes** made unused.
- **Test:** every changed line must trace directly to the user's request.

## Task Management

- **Create a task checklist** before starting work.
- **Check off each task** immediately after completion, don't batch.
- **Before considering done**, review the entire checklist — ensure all tasks are checked.
- **Goal-driven** — transform tasks into verifiable goals:
  - "Add validation" → write test for invalid input, then pass it
  - "Fix bug" → write test that reproduces, then pass it
  - "Refactor X" → ensure tests pass before and after

## Application Flow (MUST FOLLOW)

> Read `.agents/guides/ARCHITECTURE.md` for full layer map and folder contracts.

### apps/web (Next.js Frontend)

```
Rendering (UI Layer):
  apps/web/app/ (router)
    └→ page.tsx (thin Suspense wrapper)
        └→ *-page-content.tsx (Client Component — route orchestration: hooks, state, layout)
            └→ _components/ (private route components: form, table, dialog, drawer)
                └→ apps/web/components/ (reusable components: Button, Input, Table, Dialog, etc.)

Data Flow (data transactions):
  *-page-content.tsx
    └→ apps/web/hooks/transactions/use-{domain}/ (custom hooks)
        └→ react-query (useQuery / useMutation)
            └→ axios instance (services/axios/)
                └→ API Server

Validation (input):
  Form (useForm + react-hook-form)
    └→ packages/schemas/ (shared Zod schema)

Typing:
  API response → packages/types/
  Form payload → z.infer<schema> (packages/schemas/)
  General      → apps/web/types/generals/
```

**FORBIDDEN:** JSX components calling axios/fetch directly — must go through hooks.
**RECOMMENDED:** create a `_components/` folder for components used only by that route. Keep `*-page-content.tsx` beside `page.tsx` as the route orchestrator. Move components used by multiple routes to `apps/web/components/`.

### apps/api (Go Backend — Echo + Clean Architecture)

```
HTTP Request
  → apps/api/internal/interfaces/http/routes/    (bind request, delegate to controller)
  → apps/api/internal/interfaces/http/controllers/ (parse request, call service, format response)
  → apps/api/internal/application/services/       (orchestrate use case, transform Entity → DTO)
  → apps/api/internal/application/use-cases/      (business logic, return DomainError)
  → apps/api/internal/infrastructure/database/    (query via sqlc, return Entity)
  ↑
  bubbles up → ErrorHandler middleware → HTTP Response

Error Handling:
  DomainError (packages/go-shared/domain) → ErrorHandler middleware
    ├── NOT_FOUND    → 404
    ├── UNAUTHORIZED → 401
    ├── FORBIDDEN    → 403
    ├── CONFLICT     → 409
    ├── VALIDATION   → 422
    └── INTERNAL     → 500
```

**FORBIDDEN:** business logic in Controller, DB access in Use Case, echo.HTTPError from Use Case.
**NOTE:** sqlc-generated files in `internal/infrastructure/db/` must NEVER be edited manually — regenerate with `sqlc generate`.

### apps/worker (Go Worker — asynq)

```
asynq Worker
  → apps/worker/internal/infrastructure/queue/ (asynq server registration)
  → apps/worker/internal/application/use-cases/ (job handlers / use cases)
  → feature-specific job types added when actually needed
```

### packages/ (Shared)

```
packages/schemas/    → Zod schemas (frontend only — apps/web)
packages/types/      → TypeScript API response types (frontend only — apps/web)
packages/utils/      → Pure TS utilities (frontend + tooling)
packages/go-shared/  → Shared Go module (DomainError) — used by apps/api + apps/worker via go.work
```

**Shared packages rules:**
- `packages/schemas/` → only Zod schema + inferred types for frontend forms
- `packages/types/` → only TypeScript types for API responses consumed by apps/web
- `packages/utils/` → only pure functions without FE/BE-specific dependencies
- `packages/go-shared/` → only Go types/errors shared between Go apps — no TypeScript
